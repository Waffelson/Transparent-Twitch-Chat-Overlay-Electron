# Transparent Twitch Chat Overlay Electron
Twitch chat on top of windowed games for single monitor streamers 

Inspired by
[Transparent Twitch Chat Overlay](https://github.com/baffler/Transparent-Twitch-Chat-Overlay/)

This simple Electron script launches [jChat](https://www.giambaj.it/twitch/jchat/) in a frameless, transparent window with user-defined customization like opacity, font, scale, and CSS-based styling (background color, shadows, etc).

It simply show the public jChat web interface â€” no code modifications, just styled and displayed.
